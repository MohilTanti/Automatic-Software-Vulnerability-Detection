# Automatic-Software-Vulnerability-Detection

# Introduction


A vulnerability in a software can be either glitch, flaw, or weakness present in it or either in operating system. Although computer software makes the tasks easier and increase productivity, being a crucial part of our life’s, they possess some vulnerabilities which could harm the data very badly. Nowadays, the severity of software vulnerability has been seen to increase exponentially. All systems do have vulnerabilities, though the thing which matters most is whether they are exploited or not.

There are basically 3 ideal factors considered when talking about software vulnerabilities i.e., Existence, Access and Exploit. Where existence describes whether any vulnerability exist in software or not, access describes the possibility that potential hackers can get access to the vulnerability, and exploit refers to the capability of potential hackers to take benefit of the vulnerability to affect the software.

# Configuring Google Colab Environment

The whole execution of the project is to be done in the Google Colaboratory. Colab allows anybody to write and execute arbitrary python code through the browser and is especially well suited to machine learning, data analysis, and education. More technically, Colab is a hosted Jupyter notebook service that requires no setup to use, while providing free access to computing resources including GPUs.

Google Colaboratory is linked with Google Drive, so the project files are to be stored in the Google Drive folder for execution. Follow the below instructions to set up all the files for execution.

**Step 1:** Download the project .zip file from GitHub.

**Step 2:** Go to Google Drive, and create a new folder.

```
Steps to create a new folder:

1. On your computer, go to drive.google.com.
2. On the left, click New and then Folder.
3. Enter a name for the folder - "Colab Notebooks".
4. Click Create.
```

**Step 3:** Navigate to "Colab Notebooks" folder and upload DSCP folder and all the python .ipynb and .py files to the folder.

````
Steps to create upload files and folder:

1. On your computer, go to drive.google.com.
2. Open "Colab Notebooks" folder.
3. At the top left, click New > File Upload or Folder Upload.
4. Choose all files and folders from the unzipped file downloaded from GitHub.
````

**Step 4:** Make sure that the folder structure should be as follow:
```
...
├── Colab Notebooks
... ├── DSCP
    |   └── Dataset
    |   |   ├── Asterisk
    |   |   |   └── asterisk.csv
    |   |   ├── CWE119
    |   |   |   └── CGD
    |   |   |       └── cwe119_cgd.txt
    |   |   ├── CWE399
    |   |   |   └── CGD

```


# Pre-processing CWE399 & CWE119 Datasets

The real world project datasets Asterisk and FFmpeg datasets are already preprocessed. So, pre-processing of cwe399 and cwe119 datasets need to be done. Follow the below steps to perform the pre-processing and get data ready to train and test.

IMPORTANT NOTE : Make sure you mount your google drive in each of the python files you open before running the code. To mount the drive press the mount google drive icon in the menu from left. Open this link to know where you can find the option : [Mount Drive] (https://golangdocs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/mount-drive-in-colab.png)

Follow this link if facing any problem on how to run all cells in Colab Notebook : [Link](https://i.stack.imgur.com/735eb.png)

**Step 1: Processing the Codes.**

Open "CWE DATA - Preprocessing.ipynb" in Google Colab and click Runtime option from top menu and then click Run all.

**Step 2: Train Word2Vec model.**

Open "Train_Word2Vec.ipynb" file in Google Colab and click Runtime option from top menu and then click Run all.

**Step 3: Train BiLSTM model.**

Open "Train_BiLSTM.ipynb" and upload the BiLSTM_model.py from local computer to colab notebook by selecting upload option from left menu. After uploading the model click Runtime option from top menu and then click Run all.

**Step 4: Obtain the Representations**

Open "Obtain_Representations.ipynb" file and click Runtime option from top menu and then click Run all.


# Training and Testing of Models


**Step 1: Train and Test CWE399 and CWE119 Dataset.**

Open "CWE DATA - Testing.ipynb" in Google Colab and click Runtime option from top menu and then click Run all.

**Step 2: Train and Test Asterisk and FFmpeg Dataset.**

Open "Asterisk and FFmpeg - Preprocessing & Testing.ipynb" in Google Colab and click Runtime option from top menu and then click Run all.


# Generating End Result Visualisations

Open "Result_Analysis.ipynb" in Google Colab and click Runtime option from top menu and then click Run all.
